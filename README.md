# VectorTongue

*VectorTongue* is an innovative and efficient language model that leverages vector-based neural networks to process and understand language through abstract representations such as parts of speech and syntax token types. Designed to be trained on limited datasets, VectorTongue democratizes access to small, powerful language models by focusing on structural and geometric aspects of language rather than relying on massive text corpora.

## Overview

VectorTongue represents a new paradigm in language modeling by abstracting away from traditional word-based inputs. Instead, it focuses on the underlying structure of language and code, using vector neural networks to learn from parts of speech, syntax token types, and geometric waveforms. This approach allows VectorTongue to be trained with far fewer data than traditional language models, making it accessible to developers and researchers with limited resources.

## Key Features

- **Data-Efficient Learning**: Train powerful language models using small datasets by focusing on syntactic and structural representations.
- **Vector Neural Networks**: Leverage the power of Bezier Waveform Vectors (BWV) to represent and process language and code.
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Utilize advanced attention mechanisms to focus on different aspects of the BWV representations.
- **Custom Operations**: Employ custom matrix multiplication and geometric operations to optimize learning and inference.
- **Democratized Access**: Lower the barrier to entry for developing language models, enabling a wider range of applications and innovation.

## How It Works

### Bezier Waveform Vectors (BWV)

Each neuron in VectorTongue is represented as a Bezier waveform vector, which models a phase of a waveform through control points. The waveform follows the direction of an overall vector and dissipates over a length determined by the vector's magnitude. This approach captures complex patterns in the data, allowing for rich feature representation with limited input.

### Custom Matrix Multiplication

VectorTongue introduces a custom matrix multiplication operation where traditional multiplication is replaced by subtracting BWVs. These operations are summed up across neurons, enabling the model to integrate information across different dimensions of the input.

### Multi-Head Self-Attention

To enhance the model's ability to focus on specific aspects of the data, VectorTongue uses a multi-head self-attention mechanism. This allows different attention heads to concentrate on various phases and regions of the BWV representations, leading to more nuanced and powerful learning.

## Roadmap

Planned features and improvements:

- [ ] Expand language and syntax support (e.g., additional programming languages, more complex syntactic structures).
- [ ] Develop visualization tools for BWV operations and model behavior.
- [ ] Integrate with popular IDEs for real-time syntax analysis and code suggestions.
- [ ] Enhance support for multilingual natural language processing.
- [ ] Implement advanced transfer learning capabilities.
